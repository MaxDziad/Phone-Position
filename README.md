# Phone Position
A small study course project made in collaboration with @Adrian Ciesielczyk and @Amadeusz Gunia.

Made in Unity/C# with additional Python scripts.

It's an app created for mobile devices. It continuously reads data from gyroscope and accelometer, then using trained AI model, gives user info (in plain text) about what is happening to the device right now.
